# RESPONSIVE-WEBPAGE
This code creates a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML builds the page structure, CSS styles the layout and uses media queries for different screen sizes, and JavaScript adds interactivity by toggling the navigation menu and adapting the layout during screen resizing.

# 📘 DESCRIPTION OF THE RESPONSIVE WEBPAGE CODE

This code implements a responsive webpage that automatically adapts to different screen sizes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design ensures proper viewing and interaction on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

# 1️⃣ HTML – Structure of the Webpage

HTML defines the basic structure and content of the webpage.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies that the document follows HTML5 standards.

The <meta name="viewport"> tag enables proper scaling on mobile devices.

The <header> section contains:

The website title (logo)

Navigation menu

Hamburger menu icon for mobile screens

The <section> element holds the main content and a button for user interaction.

The <footer> displays copyright information.

The JavaScript code is placed at the bottom to ensure the page loads before scripts run.

# 2️⃣ CSS – Styling and Responsiveness

CSS controls the layout, appearance, and responsiveness of the webpage.

Flexbox is used to align elements in the header and navigation bar.

Colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment improve readability and visual appeal.

Media queries (@media (max-width: 768px)) detect small screens and:

Hide the navigation menu

Display the hamburger menu icon

Change navigation layout to a vertical menu

The .active class is used to show or hide the menu dynamically on mobile devices.

# 3️⃣ JavaScript – Interactivity and Screen Adaptation

JavaScript adds dynamic behavior and screen-size awareness.

An event listener detects clicks on the hamburger icon to toggle the navigation menu.

The handleResize() function checks the current screen width:

Displays the menu automatically on large screens

Hides the menu on small screens

A resize event listener updates the layout instantly when the screen size changes.

The button interaction demonstrates JavaScript’s ability to modify webpage content dynamically.

# 4️⃣ Responsive Behavior

Screen Size	Layout Behavior

Desktop 	Navigation menu always visible

Tablet	  Responsive flexible layout

Mobile	  Hamburger menu with toggle

# 5️⃣ Conclusion

This code successfully demonstrates responsive web design principles by combining HTML for structure, CSS for layout and media queries, and JavaScript for interactivity and adaptive behavior. The webpage provides a smooth and user-friendly experience across all screen sizes.
